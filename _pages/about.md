Hi, I'm **Pranav**.

I'm pursuing a Master's of Science in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, where I focus on distributed systems and database systems. I am excited about solving difficult engineering challenges and building correct, secure and scalable systems.

I bring hands-on industry experience from working with the Platform Team at [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/) and the Control Plane Team at [Datapelago](https://www.datapelago.ai/), where I tackled challenges in building performant and secure large-scale systems.

Currently, I'm working with Professor [Mohammad Javad Amiri's](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~amiri/students.html)research group, exploring isolation and consistency levels in database systems. My research aims to design databases with tunable consistency and isolation guarantees.

**I'm actively seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities in distributed systems, databases, or infrastructure engineering.**
